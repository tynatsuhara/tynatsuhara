Hi, I'm Ty â€” welcome to my web page on double-u double-u double-u dot git hub dot com. I'm a software engineer and game developer in Seattle, currently working at [System Era Softworks](https://systemera.net/). In my free time, I enjoy working on video games (like [SWAMP CAMP](https://swamp.camp)), other creative code projects, and non-computery art projects. Check out some of my pinned stuff below! :^)
