Hi, I'm Ty â€” welcome to my web page on double-u double-u double-u dot GitHub dot com. I'm a software engineer and game developer in Seattle, currently working at [Mojang Studios](https://mojang.com/). In my free time, I enjoy working on video games, other creative code projects, and non-computery art projects. Check out some of my pinned stuff below! :^)
