Hi, I'm Ty â€” welcome to my web page on double-u double-u double-u dot git hub dot com. I'm a game developer & software engineer in Seattle, currently working at [System Era Softworks](https://systemera.net/). 

In my free time, I enjoy working on creative code projects as well as non-computery art projects. Check out some of my pinned stuff below! :^)
